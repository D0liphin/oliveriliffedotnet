                I'm a third year Computer Science student at 
                <a

                </a> I like
                most of what people call "Computer Science", but there are some
                things I like more than the rest. </p> <p> I am particularly 
                interested in the tools we use to build systems that are 
                resilient, secure and fast. Roughly, this is the union of some 
                subset of programming languages and some subset of systems. I am
                interested in type systems and language features that aid 
                performance or safety, as well as efforts to formally define the
                operational semantics of unsafe, high-level languages.

    <p> 
        I value code that leverages its environment. Our operating system and processor 
        present underutilised capabilities. People seem to like to write code that 
        ignores this as if we're programming on little isolated, managed ecosystems 
        (with a big fence around them). For a subject that wouldn't exist without 
        computers, we actually don't like to think about computers that much! I like the
        complexity (and benefit!) that thinking about the <i>actual system</i> we're 
        running on brings. </p> <p> *There have been a couple of unnecessarily excellent
        professors who have made my time at KCL worthwhile. Namely, Dr Stephen Kell and 
        Dr Christian Urban. Thank you!

    <h2>Stuff I'm Good At</h2>
    <p>
        I know a reasonable amount about how to program in Rust. Not the 
        actual useful stuff (like "what is the best library for doing [complex 
        problem]"). But, I can probably nitpick your code and tell you that what
        you're doing is probably (if we had a specification) undefined
        behaviour or do some fancy stuff with traits.
