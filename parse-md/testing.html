<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>
    Here is a paragraph, which should be on a new line from the previous thing. It
    should all be in one big block, nothing fancy. No line breaks yet... stil no.
    Still no! Okay, now:
</p>
<p>
    This is on a newline. I will use this opportunity to look at some of the
    inline stylings. First we have <b>bold</b>, then we have <i>italic</i>. Very
    cool! Now, we also have <code>code snippets</code>. What's more -- we have
    <b><code>bold code snippets</code></b> and
    <i><code>italic code snippets</code></i>. We also even have inline<b>bold</b>text and inline<i>italic</i>text.
</p>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<p>
    We also have <b><i>bold italic</i></b> and
    <b><i><code>bold italic code</code></i></b>
    hopefully!
</p>
<h3>H3</h3>
<h4>H4</h4>
<h5>H5</h5>
<h6>H6</h6>
<p>We don't have h7, of course.</p>
<h3>
    Another cool thing, is that you can put <code>code</code>, <i>italic</i> etc.
    in headings!
</h3>
<h2>Code Blocks</h2>
<p>
    Okay... not sure if this is going to work. We had <code>code</code> and even
    <i><code>code</code></i>, <b><code>code</code></b> and
    <b><i><code>code</code></i></b>... but what about:
</p>
<div language="c">
    <pre>
int main() {
    printf("This is C code!");
}
</pre>
</div>
<br />
<div language="py">
    <pre>
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print("This is python :)")
</pre>
</div>
<br />
<div language="md">
    <pre>
# MD in MD?
WHAT! *italics* (but not really)
</pre>
</div>
