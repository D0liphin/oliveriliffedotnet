<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>
    Here is a paragraph, which should be on a new line from the previous
    thing. It should all be in one big block, nothing fancy. No line breaks
    yet... stil no. Still no! Okay, now:</p>
<p>
    This is on a newline. I will use this opportunity to look at some of
    the inline stylings. First we have <b>bold</b>, then we have <i>italic</i>.
    Very cool! Now, we also have <code>code snippets</code>. What's more -- we have
    <b><code>bold code snippets</code></b> and <i><code>italic code snippets</code></i>. We also even have
    inline<b>bold</b>text and inline<i>italic</i>text.
</p>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<p>
    We also have <b><i>bold italic</i></b>!</p>
<h3>H3</h3>
<h4>H4</h4>
<h5>H5</h5>
<h6>H6</h6>
<p>
    We don't have h7, of course.</p>
