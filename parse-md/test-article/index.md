# Heading 1

Here is a paragraph, which should be on a new line from the previous
thing. It should all be in one big block, nothing fancy. No line breaks
yet... stil no. Still no! Okay, now:

This is on a newline. I will use this opportunity to look at some of
the inline stylings. First we have **bold**, then we have *italic*. 
Very cool! Now, we also have `code snippets`. What's more -- we have
**`bold code snippets`** and *`italic code snippets`*. We also even have
inline**bold**text and inline*italic*text. 

We also have $equations$ like $5 + 5$ and $\sqrt{6}$

Links work too. For example, a link to [Google](https://www.google.com). 

$$\text{Equations work too } e = mc^2$$ 

## Subheading

We also have ***bold italic*** and ***`bold italic code`*** hopefully!

### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

We don't have h7, of course.

### You can put `code`, *italic* etc. in headings!

# Images 

We also have images, look:

## Code Blocks 

Okay... not sure if this is going to work. We had `code` and even 
*`code`*, **`code`** and ***`code`***... but what about:

```c
int main() {
    printf("This is C code!");
}
```

```py
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print("This is python :)")
```

```md
# MD in MD?
WHAT! *italics* (but not really)
```
