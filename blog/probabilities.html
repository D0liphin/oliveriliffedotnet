<h1>An Introduction to Probability</h1>

<p>
    Probability is a fun world. There are many things we can learn. Essentially,
    probability lets us measure "the chance" of something happening. We can model 
    every kind of probabilistic model as the "colored sweets in the bag" problem.
</p>

<p>
    Consider this, for example: we have a bag of sweets. Our favourite sweet is 
    the red sweet, but the bag also has a yellow sweet in it (it has one yellow
    sweet and one red sweet). The yellow sweets are disgusting, bleugh! Since
    we can get a red sweet or we can get a yellow sweet when we take something
    from this bag here is the set of possible options

    <pre>
    {"yellow", "red"}
    </pre>

    The calculation for probability is the chance of the event you want to have
    occur, divided by the number of possible events. In this case, that's 1
    divided by 2 which is 0.5 (50%). We say 50% because it helps us understand
    roughly what the probability is when compared to other probabilities (though
    there aren't that many probabilities -- more on that later).
</p>

<h2>A harder example</h2>

<p>
    Ok that was pretty easy! But what about something more complicated, what if 
    somone put a <b>blue</b> sweet in the bag?? Well, now the set of options 
    looks like this

    <pre>
    {"yellow", "blue", "red"}
    </pre>
</p>
<img src="blue-sweet.png">

<p>
    The math is going to be a bit harder here! 1 divided by 3? What the heck is
    that? Don't worry, if we remember that 1 divded by 2 is 50%, we can work out
    everything else based on that...
<p>
</p>
    Remember, we only care about the sweet being red or <b>not being red</b>,
    so we can group the yellow and red options into one!
</p>

<pre>
{"red", {"blue", "yellow"}} = {"red", "not red"} 
</pre>

<p>
    Now, it's easy to see that the chance that was complicated to calculate (1
    in 3) is much easier to calculate as 1 divided by 2, which is 50%. So, 
    interestingly, the chance of the sweet being red, is <b>still 50%!</b>. In 
    fact, the chance of getting a blue, yellow or red sweet is all 50%.
</p>

<h2>The Second Oliver Lemma</h2>

<p>
    Based on this information, you might be tempted to believe that all 
    probabilities are 50%. This is an easy mistake for beginners to make, but is
    actually not so! The proof is very clever indeed, reread this if you need to
    it's quite complicated.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with the assumption that every probability is 50%. It's a fair
    assumption. But, in that case, what is the probability that a probability is
    50%? Well, logically the set of possible probabilities is this
</p>
<pre>
    { 50% }
</pre>
<p>
    As a result, we do our regular calculation -- there is 1 option, so we do
    1 divided by 1... That one's pretty easy so we can't do the simplification
    from earlier. But 1 / 1 is just... 100%. Now, this might seem fine, until we
    realise that if <i>something</i> has a probability of 100%, that means the 
    set of probabilities is actually <code>{ 100%, 50% }</code>
</p>

<p>
    If you recalculate the probability of a probability being 50%, we get 50%
    now, which means we didn't need the 100% in that set anyway. However, this
    just means that something else is probably 100% likely, we just don't know
    what yet.
</p>

<h2>That's all for now</h2>

<p>
    That's all for now, more on probabilities another time.
