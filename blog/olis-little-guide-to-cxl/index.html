                <h1>Oli's Little Guide to CXL</h1><blockquote><p> test
 test
</p></blockquote><h2>breaks</h2><p>I'm working on a research project about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link">CXL (Compute Express Link)</a>
and distributed memory, so I am adding a new little guide about what CXL
actually is. Hopefully in a way that you can read this in 20 minutes 
and understand the motivation behind it. Then, you can look up the 
different parts in more detail.</p><h2>What is CXL?</h2><p>CXL is just an open standard interconnect (created by Intel). It must be
implemented at the hardware level. There are three protocols as part of
this standard. (1) CXL.io (2) CXL.cache (3) CXL.mem. </p><p>In CXL we have 'CXL hosts' (or 'CPU hosts' or 'host CPUs' etc.) and 
'CXL devices'. CXL lets us attach new devices to our host CPU. The
devices communicate with our CPU and we communicate with the devices
through CXL. </p><h2>CXL Protocols</h2><p><strong>CXL.io</strong> is functionally identical to PCIe. It allows for a variety
of control tasks, as well as non-coherent direct memory access (DMA).</p><p><strong>CXL.cache</strong> allows CXL devices to access and cache (locally) memory
from the CPU host.</p><p><strong>CXL.mem</strong> allows the host CPU to access device-attached memory. This
is referred to as "Host managed Device Memory" (HDM).</p><p>The latter two are special because they allow these memory operations
to happen in a 'cache coherent' way.</p><h2>It's All About Memory</h2><p>CXL is about accessing device memory from your host CPU and vice versa.
CXL is _all about memory_ Don't get any ideas that CXL is for something
else.</p><h2>What is Cache Coherence?</h2><p>Here is a typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache">cache</a> 
diagram:</p><p><img alt="CPUs and Caches Block Diagram. There are two CPUs each with a cache 
  connected to a shared main memory." src="image-1.png"></p><p>Consider the case where CPU 1 writes some value. Upon write, the cache
line is moved from main memory into its cache, then it is updated. If,
before we write-through to main memory (if that is the policy of the 
CPU), CPU 2 decides to read the same cache line, it must know that the
CPU 1 has updated it. Otherwise, there will be some inconsistency 
between the two caches.</p><p>This is the whole problem of cache coherence and we need a way to manage
it. CXL works in a cache coherent way, whereas regular PCIe memory
accesses do not. Wikipedia says this means:</p><blockquote><p> In a cache coherent system, if multiple clients have a cached copy of
 the same region of a shared memory resource, all copies are the same.
</p></blockquote><p>I'm not a huge fan of this definition. Really, it should say that we 
have some mechanism to wait for those copies to be the same or 
something. </p><p>Anyway, let's look at a use case of CXL that takes advantage of this.</p><h2>Use Case</h2><p>We have some kind of accelerator (processor that does a certain job
better than our CPU) e.g. a GPU. If a GPU wants memory at the moment,
it does so with a non-coherent DMA over PCIe.</p><ol><li><p> Allocate buffer in host memory
</p></li><li><p> GPU makes request to the CPU
</p></li><li><p> Vaddr is translated
</p></li><li><p> Memory controller responds to RC
</p></li><li><p> CPU responds to GPU
</p></li><li><p> GPU puts memory in the right spot etc. </p></li></ol><p>It would be much easier and more useful if we could just have a cache
on the accelerator and do access of host memory through normal reads
and writes. </p><p><img alt="Block diagram. There is an accelarator NIC with a cache connected to a 
  CPU via CXL. The CPU has two blocks of memory connected to it over
  DDR" src="image.png"></p><p>In the case where the cache is never invalidated (which is the assumed
case in the 'old way') there shouldn't be any speed decrease. But we 
probably want to access parts of the same data structure from the host
or the devices. More formally (from the CXL consortium):</p><blockquote><p> This poses a barrier for new usage models such as Artificial
 Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and smart network interface
 cards (NICs) where devices seek to access parts of the same data
 structures simultaneously with the CPU using device-local caches
 without moving entire data structures back and forth.
</p></blockquote><h2>Implementation</h2><p>This section discusses possible implementation details. Unless you are
implementing CXL yourself, you do not need to understand exactly how it
is implemented. Therefore, this section aims to demystify such a
protocol, without delving too deep.</p><h3>MESI Protocol</h3><p>Time for a lesson in cache coherency protocols. This is the hardware
protocol that enforces that our caches are 'coherent'. A pretty common
protocol is 'MESI' and it is also the one that CXL uses. Each of these
four letters represents a different state that a cache line can be in.
Specifically they encode two things: (1) is the cache line the same as
in main memory? (if it is, we call it 'clean', otherwise it's called
'dirty') (2) Do any other caches have a copy of this?.</p><pre lang=""><code>| Clean/Dirty | Exclusive/Shared |     Name      |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Dirty    |      Shared      | Doesn&apost exist |
|    Dirty    |    Exclusive     | Modified (M)  |
|    Clean    |      Shared      |  Shared (S)   |
|    Clean    |    Exclusive     | Exclusive (E) |
</code></pre><p>The final state 'I' is really just a marker to say a cache line is 
free. It stands for 'Invalid'. </p><p>Whenever we do a read to some cache, we broadcast on some bus "hey
everyone, I want to read this thing". If some other cache has that cache
line in state M, it broadcasts back "wait, I already have that". Then,
we can read the value from it and set both states to S. Other states
result in different resolution methods. For example, if some cache wants
to update the state of some data from S to M (because it writes to it),
we need to invalidate all other copies.</p><p>This is just one of many possible 'snooping' designs. A snooping
coherence protocol is one that works by caches broadcasting updates and
other caches making sure that they snoop in on these broadcasts and make
sure they update their state accordingly. The specifics don't really
matter, you just need to understand that this can be achieved like this.</p><p>Our previous diagram needs to be updated to look something like this:</p><p><img alt="Shows three caches all connected hierarchically to a shared memory. 
  Each cache is also connected to a shared red wire labelled 'common 
  broadcasting bus'." src="image-2.png"></p><h3>CXL.cache</h3><p>At a high-level CXL.cache implements the MESI protocol. There are
different message types that the device can send to the host and vice
versa.</p><p>The device has various kinds of commands it can send. Most obvious are
<code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code>. <code>Read</code> allows a device to request coherence state
and data _for_ a cache line. <code>Write</code> is used for the device to evict
data from the device cache. For both, the host tells the device what
state is globally observed (GO) by the system.</p><p>The host can also send 'snoop's to the device to update its cache, or
to read the current cache state from the device. Let's look at an 
example.</p><p><img alt="Read Flow time/agents graph. Time flows downwards and the graph shows
  how messages are pinged between the CXL device, Peer cache and home
  agent" src="image-3.png"></p><p>Here, the CXL device wants to read something and have it be in state
S, so they do <code>RdShared</code>. The host first snoops on a peer cache. The 
peer cache is responsible for downgrading its cache line state and 
sending back a message to the host telling it that it has done so.
Finally, the host reports that the cache line is globally observed as
S and sends the data. Notice how simultaneously, data is also read.
This is where we get the data from. This can be any kind of memory 
controller.</p><p>These requests are (dubious source) propagated by the IMC (integrated
memory controller) on the processor of the CXL device. It's supposed to
be clever enough to figure out that it needs to translate say a <code>mov</code>
into a RdShared or something. From the perspective of the CXL device,
this is just a memory read with maybe a bit more latency than normal,
but all the regular pipelining mechanisms should still work. Note that 
if the data is already cached, we don't need to send a <code>RdShared</code> and 
no such request is sent. Our request never even hits the IMC of the 
device, it just goes straight to device cache!</p><p>How clever. We send off our read/write, the host updates all peer caches
and sends us back our data. If it's already in cache, we just read/write
straight away. </p><h3>CXL.mem</h3><p>CXL.mem uses "host-managed device memory" (HDM). The basic form of the 
protocol does not allow the device to also cache the host memory. A
more complicated version _does_, though.</p><p>Memory that is host-managed coherent is called HDM-H and memory that is
device-managed coherent is called HDM-D. The way HDM-D is managed much
in the same way as CXL.cache, in fact, certain parts of it actually do
perform CXL.cache requests to the host. I don't think going through the
specifics here provides much additional benefit. (Perhaps if I find a
use for some of the specifics here, I will add something to the article
in the future).</p><p>HDM-H exposes an additional 2-bits for each cache-line, which would have
been used by the device to store cache state before. Who knows what 
you can do with this, but maybe something clever.</p><h3>The Whole Thing</h3><p>This image shows how we can use the protocols I've described earlier.</p><p><img alt="Diagram showing all the constituent parts of CXL connected. Important 
  details are explained below in a way that is mindful of users who 
  cannot see this image." src="image-4.png"></p><p>The diagram shows a multicore CPU in socket 0. It has 4 cores, each 
core has a unique L1 cache, each pair of cores share L2 cache. All
four cores share L3 cache (LLC). </p><p>This CPU has decided to implement CXL.cache at the LLC. This is not the
only possible design but makes good sense for a number of reasons. (1)
CXL.cache defines host-to-device semantics, not core-to-device. (2) 
Implementing at a higher level cache introduces significant complexity.
L1/L2 coherence is already managed by a proprietary protocol which is
not CXL, so multiplexing with this protocol would be challenging. (3)
If L3 is inclusive, we have to write to it anyway, so this design may
not degrade performance as much as we expect. I'm just guessing on that
one though.</p><p>The device connected through CXL.cache could also access host memory
non-coherently over CXL.io. In this design, we pass through the same
cache. Again this seems to make most sense if L3 is inclusive.</p><p>CXL.mem devices are also attached to the CPU socket behind its home
agent. The home agent is supposed to maintain coherence for a certain
address space. Not only do requests by cache to main DDR-attached memory
pass through the home agent, it is also responsible for attaching
additional CPUs through a proprietary interconnect. It is natural in
this design to put CXL.mem devices behind the home agent, as this is the
same location DDR-attached memory would go.</p><p><!-- ## CXL 2.0 --></p><p><!-- I bet you're excited for this. That was just CXL 1.0. </p><p>Multiple hosts may wish to use multiple devices, with some overlap.</p><p>In order to achieve this, we use a CXL switch.</p><p>A CXL switch fits into a PCIe slot (I'm guessing?).</p><p>We physically connect both hosts to the CXL switch.</p><p>However, while they are both physically just connected to the switch
as normal, they see a virtual CXL switch instead, as configured inside
the CXL switch.</p><p>Each host has a complete view of the network defined by the CXL 
switch. This view is called the virtual hierarchy (VH).</p><p>Virtual CXL switches are configured by the fabric manager and do the
routing.</p><p>all output devices are connected to the same physical CXL switch. </p><p>The CXL switch determines which one to output to based on the active
virtual bridges as managed by the virtual cxl switches.</p><p>However, this virtualization is done by the CXL switch by tracking the
address maps, which is expensive so we cannot scale more than a single
layer in CXL 2.0. --></p>
