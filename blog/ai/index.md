# My Thoughts on AI

AI [1] is exceedingly cool, and it excites me that we use computers to
do complicated statistics for the betterment of the world. I am
particularly convinced by what AI/ML has done and can do for the medical
world, (cyber) security, agriculture or for material sciences. I think
there is a useful cultural shift, where we understand that lots of
classification problems can be solved quite well with a rigorous,
data-driven approach.

However, I find the AI 'boom' concerning. Swathes of very ambitious
people are eager to see how they can create something useful with AI.
These ideas involve things like *"replacing your HR staff with
generative AI"*, *"huge gambling machine"* or *"massive army of AI
drones"*. Some of the pressing problems of our time. Huge tech companies
and governments are pumping money into buiding infrastructure for ideas
like this. So much, in fact, that in the US, estimates put data center
construction at 92% of GDP growth. It seems many entrepreneurs would
love to see generative AI take a sledgehammer to any and all industries,
in the hopes that their rebuilding would result in a tidy profit.

It leaves me wondering if anyone wants any of this? It's unclear to me
how many of these seemingly brilliant ideas will benefit any user. We
should ask what makes us happy: feeling safe, skilled, able and healthy,
having healthy relationships, being part of a community, and feeling
purposeful. A normal life fulfills can fulfill these things, and
normally people who are discontent are missing one of these. I have a
job, I am a shoemaker. I perform skilled work and am well educated. I am
able to get to work using my bicycle. While I travel, I don't feel
unsafe. I look after my parents, I chat with my customers and the
butcher and the lady at the grocery store. I feel part of my community.
I am well respected as a shoemaker and my income helps pay taxes to keep
the cycle lanes in order and to keep the shoes on peoples feet stuck  
together.

The AI entrepreneurs would look at a happy life like this and convince
us that it could be made better. And we'll believe them, because
technology is of course good; it brought us the Polio vaccine and the
Nintendo DS and so on. It would be better if my accountants were
chatbots. It would be better if my communications with my letting agency
were generated. It would be so much easier if my butcher trip was
replaced by a 'meat subscription' that modelled what cuts of beef I
would most like. It would be so efficient if the newspaper was replaced
by a generated summary of the news that is most useful to me. It would
save me so much money to get my logo designed by an image generator,
rather than an artist. I would like to see my search results be
aggregated into a couple maybe-correct, maybe-incorrect, authorless
paragraphs. The best way to spend my evenings is on the fun
video-sharing app that repeatedly selects a perfect fifteen-second video
for exactly me until I have spent hours doing that without my even
realising it. I want the stock market to be completely uncompetitive for
people without petabytes of data to train huge models. I want gambling
companies to have further edge against me without my knowing it. I don't
want to read human prose. I don't want to write human prose. I don't
want to see human photography or paintings. I don't want to hear human
music.

Of course, this is not really a point about AI, but rather the
capitalist's ignorance of how his choices really affect peoples lives.
It's a worry about how continuously making the tools he has more
powerful can make our lives worse and more unequal. 

### Footnotes

1. I have a quick note on definitions. *'AI'* to me is any program that
seems 'intelligent'. Therefore 'AI' encompasses purely rule-based chat
bots as well, that a human can write by hand. 'Stockfish', a program
from 2008 that plays chess better than any human, is also under the
umbrella of 'AI'. Of course, ChatGPT is also AI. It's a bit
loosey-goosey, but the point is that ChatGPT is just one branch of AI
whose goal is to 'generate' novel content. ChatGPT, Sora, whatever are
all called 'Gen-AI'.
